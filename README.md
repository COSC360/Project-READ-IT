# MyDiscussionForum

## Project Description

Our team will undertake the MyDiscussionForum project, a forum-style website intended to facilitate online user discussions. The discussions can be of any topic of the user’s choosing and depend on other user's participation.

Registered users will be allowed to create discussion posts of any topic, and reply to other users’ discussion posts. The user also may edit their own discussion posts. Unregistered users can view discussion posts, but cannot reply to them. Admin users will be created to moderate the MyDiscussionForum website, by being able to delete forums, comments and users.

The inspiration of the project will be Reddit and similar online discussion forums. There will also be page for each dedicated user type.
